## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HermanTeng19/AI-Content-Detector-by-GenAI.git
   cd AI-Content-Detector-by-GenAI
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with your RapidAPI key (optional):
   ```
   RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_api_key_here
   RAPIDAPI_HOST=ai-content-detector-ai-gpt.p.rapidapi.com
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## Usage

1. Enter or paste text into the textarea
2. Click the "Detect AI Content" button
3. View the analysis results with probability scores and text statistics
4. Check the verdict to see if the text is likely AI-generated or human-written

## How It Works

The application uses pattern recognition and statistical analysis to identify characteristics commonly found in AI-generated text. When you submit content for analysis, the app:

1. Sends the text to our API endpoint
2. Processes the text through our detection algorithm
3. Calculates probability scores for AI vs. human authorship
4. Extracts text statistics like word count and sentence structure
5. Presents the results in an easy-to-understand visual format
